	<p class ="col-sm-8" >Environment pollution is one of the major human created problems that we are facing today. Pollution is a result of population explotion, technological advancement, so called industrial revolutions and human desire towards ease of life. Literally we killed our surrounding environment in the race for survival of the fittest but we forgot that we are not independent, we are dependent species. We used science and technology to serve our needs. This is the time that we need to use technology and science to protect motherearth. Our generation is meant for that purpose. To prevent pollution we need an effective analysis of the cause of pollution, present situation and future predictions of the global pollution index. It needs highly robust, reliable and optimal systems, computational techniques and implementation strategies. Our goal is to build a system that can provide informations about the quantity of pollutants in the environment at present and analyse the raw results using computational techniques. The results of analysis will be used to predict the possible future states of pollutant quantity and to take prevention measures. At present we are developing only air pollution monitoring system. Adjuscent diagram is a schematic representation of how air pollution happens.</p>
